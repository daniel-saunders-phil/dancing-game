# dancing-game
An agent-based model for exploring the evolution of gendered behaviour and social learning. The modeling approach draws heavily
on evolutionary game theory and [this book](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198789970.001.0001/oso-9780198789970).
This project expands on that book to explore how gendered social learning might have co-evolved with gendered behaviour. A more detailed description of the model
can be found inside the file.

There are four kinds of files in the repository:

The primary file is the model itself. It is written in netlogo.
You can download netlogo or get access to a browser-based netlogo environment [here](https://www.netlogoweb.org/). The fastest way to explore this file is to download it to your computer and then upload the file to Netlogo Web.

The second kind of file is the data analysis. The data analysis was originally done with Jupyter notebooks but I've also created version of the file in base python and html. The data analysis file can be read in a lot of ways but I recommend using Jupyter notebooks.

The third type of file is a cluster of csv files which contain a bunch of data produced by the netlogo model. The data analysis file will need to use them to produce figures.

The fourth type of file is a pdf of the paper written about this model. It's probably the best place to start if you are interested in this project. It provides context and justification for the modeling framework and summarizes many of the major results. The other three kinds of files should give you enough tools to reproduce every figure and number in the paper. If you run into problems with reproduction, send me an email or raise an issue on github.
